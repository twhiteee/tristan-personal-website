                <p id="shakySuds">I am a Cornell University Mechanical Engineering graduate with a passion for product design and entrepreneurship. I am currently working on my startup: <a id="shakySudsLink" href="https://www.shakysuds.com/" target="_blank">Shaky Suds</a>. Shaky Suds is bringing to market a new, faster way to wash dirty dishes by hand for people who don't have a dishwasher.</p>
                <p id="johnsonControls">Previous to Shaky Suds, I worked as a product research & design engineer at <a id="johnsonControlsLink" href="https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/" target="_blank">Johnson Controls</a>. I worked for their retail solutions division, developing/launching new RFID sensors used to improve anti-theft and inventory management systems for retail stores.</p>
                <p id="amphenolSVMicrowave">Previous to Johnson Controls, I was a product development engineer at <a id="amphenolSVMicrowaveLink" href="https://www.svmicrowave.com/" target="_blank">Amphenol SV Microwave</a>, a manufacturer of connector, adapter, and cable assembly products for RF and Mil/Aero industries. In addition to product development, I developed assembly process automation machinery for production teams and equipment for testing new solutions. I even used my programming skills to automate repetitive engineering tasks across multiple departments.</p>
                <p id="hogTechnologies">Previous to SV, I was a design engineer at <a id="hogTechnologiesLink" href="https://thehog.com/" target="_blank">Hog Technologies</a>, a leading manufacturer of vehicles that develop/maintain roadways and airport runways. My work focused on development of the Thermo Hog – A thermoplastic longline truck used to paint roadway markings.</p>
                <p id="airTechniques">Previous to HOG, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at <a id="airTechniquesLink" href="https://www.airtechniques.com/en/" target="_blank">Air Techniques</a>, a global manufacturer of medical devices for the dental industry. I was responsible for​ packaging design, prototype, and testing initiatives for Air Techniques' novel digital radiography solutions.</p>
                <p id="lufthansaTechnik">My interest in design started during my cumulative nine months interning as a programmer and supply chain analyst for <a id="lufthansaTechnikLink" href="https://www.lufthansa-technik.com/" target="_blank">Lufthansa Technik</a>'s Consumables and Expendables department. I was responsible for developing/implementing software that streamline and automate company procedures/reports.</p>
                <p id="closingStatements">My experience designing multiple hardware and software solutions has taught me a lot about myself. Coming up with product ideas has shown me how uniquely I view the world and its many inefficiencies. Brainstorming different designs has shown me how creative and inventive I am. Successfully turning these ideas into physical, working prototypes and final products proves my ability to get things done and create real-world impact.</p>
                <p id="goodbyes">I am excited to build upon my experiences so I can achieve my goal of having a fulfilling career making products that people love.</p>
